![Part-Timr App](https://mikeroscoop.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/parttimr-promo.png)

GrabTaxi and Upwork cross-over iPhone app for freelancing. Part-Timr App is basically a GrabTaxi app, but instead of a driver and a rider, we have a Part-Timr and a Hirer. 

Part-Timr App makes use of the idle resources in colleges such as knowledge and freelancing skills and connects Part-Timrs (students) based on their needs and their ability to help a client (Hirer).

## Two separate apps

* App for [Hirer](https://github.com/MikeCorpus/Part-Timr_Employer).
* App for [Part-Timr](https://github.com/MikeCorpus/Part-Timr_Employee).


## Built With

* [Xcode 8](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) - Most of the work was done here.
* [Swift 3](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) - The programming language.
* [Firebase](http://firebase.google.com/) - Database.
* [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) - UI Design.


## Versioning

I used [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [tags on this repository](https://github.com/MikeCorpus/Part-Timr_Employer/tags).

## Major modifications to add

* Chat feature - to ease communication between the Hirer and the Part-timr.
