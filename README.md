![Part-Timr App](https://mikeroscoop.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/part-timr-logo.png)

GrabTaxi and Upwork cross-over iPhone app for freelancing. Part-Timr App is basically a GrabTaxi app, but instead of a driver and a rider, we have a Part-Timr and a Hirer. 

Part-Timr App makes use of the idle resources in colleges such as knowledge and freelancing skills and connects Part-Timrs (students) based on their needs and their ability to help a client (Hirer).
